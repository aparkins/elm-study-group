# Let's learn Elm together!

To get started, do three things:

1. Install Elm

`https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html`

2. Clone this repo

`git clone git@github.com:aparkins/elm-study-group.git`

3. Setup packages

`elm-package install elm-lang/html`

Then you should be able to open `elm-repl` and get started!
